                Flora grew up in Castro Valley, a true child of the Bay Area. A summer in Seattle threatened briefly to pull her away, but the bay eventually called her home. She recently completed her second stint at Cal, earning her MBA from Haas, and started a new job at <a href="https://schoolzilla.org">Schoolzilla</a>, an education technology startup based in Oakland.
              </p>
              <p>
                Flora’s capacity to care about and for her loved ones is incredible. The same passion and attention to detail that serve her so well professionally manifest in her relationships, and her friends and family benefit from that energy and love. Despite her current obsession with <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-vmpSRhyHu6w/URPXuw5xU_I/AAAAAAAGq7c/z1QpMpxP4J8/IMG_8051.jpg?imgmax=800">French</a> <a href="http://distilleryimage1.s3.amazonaws.com/ae7299fa535411e28a5c22000a1f8acf_7.jpg">Bulldogs</a> (though she claims she doesn't actually want one), Jon feels blessed and proud to be sharing his life with her!

                Jon hails from Fresno, CA (Fres-yes, as they say). He came to the Bay Area for his undergrad studies at Cal where he studied Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science and has worked in technology ever since. He currently lives in Emeryville and works in Google's San Francisco office.

              <p>
                Those who know Jon know that underneath the quiet exterior, is a generous heart, an understated sense of humor, and an incredible amount of patience. He goes to great lengths to ensure that people and things he cares about are taken care of. Jon is as low maintenance as they come, enjoying the simple pleasures in life&mdash;good food (or even not so good food), amusing YouTube videos, cool dogs, video games, and being around those he loves.

            At some point in college, the tradition of Valentine's dinner at <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com">In-N-Out</a> started (don't worry, it was Flora's idea). The annual tradition is still running 8 years strong and is a testament to what they appreciate as a couple: meaningful traditions rather than grand gestures, west coast roots, not having to make reservations or wait for a table (unless it’s <a href="http://www.theboilingcrab.com">The Boiling Crab</a>), and a good burger every once in awhile.

            <strong>Schedule</strong>
            <p>
              The ceremony will start at <strong>3pm</strong>, followed by a cocktail hour and the reception in the same location. Yes, it'll be an early dinner&mdash;that's a good thing, right? :)
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Getting There</strong>
            <p>
              Driving inside the park can be a little difficult (and cell phone service is a bit spotty). We recommend taking Shasta Road or Wildcat Canyon Road into the park from the Berkeley side, east of the golf course.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, the park district has informed us that South Park Drive (the southern path leading up to the venue) will be closed this winter to protect migrating newts. Please plan your route accordingly!
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Parking</strong>
            <p>
              There is a parking lot outside the Brazilian Room and an overflow lot one street away.

        There will be a place for monetary gifts at the wedding. If you'd like to support us with gift cards from any of these places we frequent, it would certainly be appreciated as well!

        As we combine our lives and our things, we realize that we have most of what we need and are well on our way to filling what will be our cozy apartment. If you like things, though, there are definitely some things we have been eyeing on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/15SE9OIECRJ4S">Amazon</a> to make our new home even nicer!

	      		We have set up a hotel block at the Four Points Sheraton in Emeryville (about 6 miles from the ceremony and reception site). The group rate is available until November 18, and includes parking, internet, and a light continental breakfast. You can book using the information below.

          	If you’re staying in the hotel block you’ll be in Jon’s neighborhood of Emeryville, and within walking distance of a few different ways to pass time.
          	<ul>
          		<li>
          			<a href="http://www.baystreetemeryville.com">Bay Street</a><br>
    						Catch a movie at the AMC Bay Street 16, shop at Uniqlo, grab a snack at Cornology, or otherwise entertain yourselves at this retail village. If all else fails, go across the street to Ikea and easily lose track of an hour or two (we do this all the time).
    					</li>
    					<li>
    						<a href="http://www.publicmarketemeryville.com">Public Market</a><br>
    						There’s a nice little food court here with some variety, but our favorite place to eat at Public Market is a pizza place called Hot Italian.
    					</li>
    					<li>
    						Powell Street Plaza (on Christie Ave between Bay St and Powell St)<br>
    						Whatever you didn’t find at Bay St or Public Market, you can probably find here. There’s a Trader Joe’s and some more shopping, as well as a few fast food places.
